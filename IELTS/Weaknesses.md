### Listening
1. Lose attention to current question because of still thinking about previous one.
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Listening / Question 28:
		- Answered 27, but still wasn't sure so was still checking 27, meanwhile missed audio for 28
2. The answer may come ***after*** the connecting elements, which was missed
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Listening / Question 36:
		-  Catarina Miranada focused on the **?** of urban and rural blackbirds
		-  Catarina Miranada done experiments with blackbirds ***living*** (wrong) in urban and rural areas. She's been looking at their ***behaviour*** (correct)
3. The answer might be very different, rather than being one of the words used in the audio. Therefore the correct answer could not be linked with the audio and unrelated audio was linked, resulting in wrong answer
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Listening / Question 25:
		- Audio: ...analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seed that germinated...
		- Correct answer: analysis of seed germination statistics
		- Wrong answer: diagram of plant development (chosen because failed to recognize correct answer and chose the next best thing)
### Reading
1. Missed keywords that link the question and the answer
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Reading / Question 6:

		- Answer in text: The travel planner offered suggested routes and public transport options between the chosen locations. There were also links to ***accommodation*** in the area
2. **IMPORTANT: TRUE (YES) / FALSE (NO) / NOT GIVEN** - could not find key sentences

	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Reading / Question 13:
		- Answer: unlikely to return to New Zealand: TRUE
		- keyword in text: often seen as a once-in-a-lifetime visit
3. **TRUE / FALSE / NOT GIVEN** - an amount comprised of multiple elements, one of which is the answer. But the correct answer is FALSE because we have to take into account all elements.
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Reading / Question 10:
		- Text says: while <strong>transport and accommodation</strong> account for the remaining <strong>26%</strong>.
		- I understood: only accommodation is 26%

		- Para 6: Starts by asking why such reaction and provides a clue in Moffat's research
5. **IMPORTANT: YES / NO / NOT GIVEN** - Question about whether two persons' opinions agree or contradict each other. They may use very different words but the basic idea might agree with each other.
	- i.e. IELTS 13 / Test 1 / Reading / Question 40:
		- Answer: Krueger doubts Bloom: FALSE
		- Bloom says: the pleasure we stem from the creative process behind the work
		- Krueger says: people's enjoyment of an artwork increases if they think more time and effort was needed to create it
