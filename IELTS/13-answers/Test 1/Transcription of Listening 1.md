You will hear a number of different recordings and you will have to answer questions on what you hear. There will be time for you to read the instructions and questions and you'll have a chance to check your work. All the recordings will be played ***once*** only. The test is in four sections. At the end of the test you will be given 10 minutes to transfer your answers to an answer sheet. 

Now turn to section 1.

Section 1: You will hear a telephone conversation between a woman who wants to attend a cookery class and an ***official*** at a tourist information center. First you have some time to look at questions 1-6.

You will see that there is an example that has been done for you. On this occasion only, the conversation relating to this will be played first. 

> Hello, tourist info center. Mark speaking. How can I help you?

> Oh, hi. I wanted to find out about cookery classes. I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists.

> Well, they are open to everyone. But, tourists are always welcome. Okay, let me give you some details what's available. There are several classes. One very popular one is ***The Food Studio***. 

The first cooking class is at The Food Studio. So ***Studio*** has been written in the space. Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Listen carefully and answer question 1-6.

> Okay!

> They focus on seasonal products. And as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to ***1. choose*** them.

> Right, that sounds good. How big are the classes?

> I'm not sure exactly but they'll be quite small.

> And could I get a ***2. private*** lesson there?

> I think so. Let me check. Yes, they ***do*** offer those. Though, most of the people who attend the classes find it's a nice way getting to know one another.

> I suppose it must be, yes. 

> And this company has a special deal for clients, where they offer a discount of ***3. 20%*** if you return for a further class.

> Okay, but you said there were several classes. 

> That's right. Another one you might be interested in is Bond's Cookery School. They're quite new. They just opened 6 months ago. But I've heard good things about them. They concentrate on teaching you to prepare ***4. healthy*** food. And they have quite a lot of specialist staff.

> So, is that food for people on a diet and things like that? I don't know if I'd be interested in that. 

> Well, I don't think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss. It's more to do with recipes that look at specific needs. Like, including ingredients that will help build up your ***5. bones*** or make them stronger, that sort of thing.

> I see. Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure. Do they have a website I could check? 

> Yes, just key in the name of the school, it'll come up. And if you want to learn more about them, every Thursday evening they have a ***6. lecture*** at the school. It's free. and you don't need to book or anything. Just turn up at 7.30. And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.
