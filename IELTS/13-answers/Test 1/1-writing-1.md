The maps show the changes in road access to a city hospital that were made between 2007 and 2010. Overall, it is demonstrated that there were a few landmarks that have been moved to new places and some new infrastructure were added.

Regarding to the map of 2007, it can be noticed that the entrance to the hospital from the city road was straightforward that went through a few bus stops on hospital road. There was only one parking space, used by both the public and staff, which was placed east of the same road.

After the changes were put in place, the map of 2010 illustrates that the bus stops were moved out of hospital road and into their own bus station west of the road, while a pair of roundabouts were added to connect the bus station to hospital road on both ends. The parking space was split into separate parking lots - the previous one was made staff only and a new car park was added east of the hospital that is intended for the public.

The maps illustrate some changes that were made to a city hospital's transport infrastructure between the years 2007 and 2010. It is noticeable that three main modifications were made to the hospital's vehicle access. These involved the building of a new bus station, new roundabouts and new parking facilities.

Looking at the changes in more detail, we can see that in 2007 there were three bus stops on either side of Hospital Road. These were no longer present in 2010, and instead we see the addition of a bus station on the west side of Hospital Road. This bus station is accessed via two new roundabouts; the first roundabout is at the intersection of City Road and Hospital Road, while the second is at the other end of Hospital Road, at the junction with the hospital ring road. 

The two maps also show that changes were made to public and staff parking areas. In 2007, staff and visitors used the same car park, which was situated to the east of Hospital Road and accessed via the ring road. However, by 2010 this original car park had become a designated area for staff parking only. A new car park, located on the east side of the ring road, provided parking for members of the public.
