The graph represents the percentage of owned and rented homes in England and Wales from the year 1918 to 2011. At a glance, it is apparent that the number of bought living spaces had a steady incline, while the number of rentals went down in similar fashion.

It can observed from the chart that, in 1918, only around 25% of all homes in England and Wales were owned by residents. While this number increases to around 30% and stays stabilizes for the years 1939 and 1953, the following years see a stable rise until 2001, where it reaches to around 70% of households and then falls to around 65% in 2011.

On the other hand, the percentage of rental homes fall from around 75% from 1918 and steadily falls to around 30% in 2001 and goes up a little to 35% in 2011. In the year 1971 the percentage of owned and rented home reaches an equilibrium with both at 50%.

In conclusion, it can be said that throughout the 20th century, the English people went on to gradually owning more homes than renting them.
