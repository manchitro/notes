## How Credential Storage Works

1. **Credential Helper**: By configuring Git with `credential.helper store`, you instruct Git to remember your credentials by saving them in the `.git-credentials` file. This means that after you enter your personal access token the first time, Git will store it and automatically use it for future operations.
2. **Persistence**: The credentials stored in the `.git-credentials` file are persistent, meaning they will remain there until you either delete the file or change your credentials.
3. **No Repeated Prompts**: Once your credentials are stored, you won't be prompted for your personal access token again for operations involving the same repository, as Git will pull the token directly from the `.git-credentials` file.

## Important Considerations

- **Security**: Since the `.git-credentials` file contains your token in plaintext, ensure that its permissions are set appropriately to prevent unauthorized access. You can set the permissions with:bash
    
    `chmod 600 ~/.git-credentials`
    
- **Alternative Methods**: If you prefer not to store your token in plaintext, consider using the `cache` option instead:bash
    
    `git config --global credential.helper cache`
    This will keep your credentials in memory for a default of 15 minutes (you can adjust the timeout if needed).
- **SSH Keys**: For an even more secure and convenient method, consider using SSH keys for GitHub authentication. This method eliminates the need for a personal access token altogether and provides a secure way to authenticate without entering credentials repeatedly.

By following these guidelines, you can streamline your Git operations without the hassle of repeated password prompts.
