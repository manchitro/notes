###### Summary 
It can be said that in [[Tabin_Sir_Context_Enabled_Query_and_Minimalist_Metadata_Visu.pdf|Context Query by Tabin Sir]], by analyzing what metadata humans think are adequate to find an entity, and using that information to attempt to optimize search engines in order to utilize the least amount of metadata to achieve the goal of entity search. Additionally, enabling engines to ask iteratively for more context until the amount for a satisfactory search can be reached.
###### Future works
In the future works section of [[Tabin_Sir_Context_Enabled_Query_and_Minimalist_Metadata_Visu.pdf|Context Query by Tabin Sir]], it is said

> The future work have planned to develop a complete semantic engine that will understand the context boundary by collecting information about entity, context or event, try to reduce the context edge and minimize context metadata. The engine will have the ability to use iterative query if context boundary is unknown or too large.

The semantic engine, if put in a context of a search engine for example, with a goal of identifying entities. In order to do that it has to understand the context in which the search was initialized, something that current search engines like Google, lack. Collecting context will be highly dependant on:
1. The interface between the engine and user.
	- Which, in most cases will be a smartphone.
2. The amount of relevant (to the current context) information the engine already has access to.
4. The amount of additional information the user is prepared to provide to the engine.
5. Most importantly, the trust between the 
#### The perfect engine conversation 

###### Context 1: Sibling
>Hey engine, I am trying to find my sibling on the web. Here is a Photo which I think should be enough.

at this point the engine may find the person, or may not, using the provided picture. If not, the engine may ask for additional metadata in the following fashion.

> I could not find anyone using the picture. Please provide some more information about your sibling. Such as, Full Name, Date of birth, nickname etc. 

### The issue of trust
Encryption algorithms are widely used and many people trust them for their proven invulnerability, even if most people do not understand how they work. People do not trust the algorithms per se, but their widespread use has assured them that they can rely on these algorithms to keep their data or money safe. These algorithms are widely used because they have stood the test of enough time and remained unbroken. For a technology to become trusted by the masses, it must go through the following steps:
1. Technology is invented and their use cases are demonstrated.
2. Invulnerability is mathematically proven by experts in their field.
3. The proof reaches scientific consensus.
4. Technology is implement for consumer use.
5. Technology gradually becomes widely used and at the same time withstand the effort from "hackers" to find vulnerabilities.
